<B>Introduction</B><BR />
<BR />
Brad Voris has been working in Information Technology and Cybersecurity for over 25 years. He began his career in 1999 where he spent 15 years building a solid foundation in the IT field. In 2016, thanks to the suggestion of a colleague, Brad began studying to attain his CISSP Security Certification.<BR /><BR />

After passing the exam and officially entering the Security field, Brad continued his upward trend through the acquisition of an array of certifications: CISSP, CISM, CCSP, CCSK, Network+, MCP, MTA, VCA-DCV, NSE1, NSE2, NSE3, ACE, 100W – OPSEC, Trustee, AZ900, SC900, and Licensed Private Investigator for the State of Texas. Brad completed an Cybersecurity degree program with Wilmington University.<BR /><BR />

Continued knowledge and high-level performance has led him to work with a list of enterprise organizations including United Airlines, Texas Children’s Hospital, and Walmart. <BR /><BR />

He was quoted in the August 2017 issue of IS Decisions magazine, commenting on the insecurities of Microsoft Active Directory, stating: “Audit logs are in the form of event logs with specific error messages, some of which require Group Policy configuration changes on the Domain Controller Default Policy. Initially, there is VERY limited logs and in order to get more data you have to make a fair amount of changes to Group Policy. Very important.” <BR /><BR />

Brad’s accomplishments don’t end in the workplace though. He has co-authored two books in his field: Intrusion Detection Guide (Chapter 10: Compliance Frameworks), and Essentials of Cybersecurity (Chapter 8: Understanding Central Areas of Enterprise Defense). <BR /><BR />

Brad continues to work in IT and Cybersecurity while also sharing his knowledge and experience with others through a mentorship program where he gives guidance to up-and-comers seeking counsel in the field. <BR /><BR />

Brad graduated from Wilmington University with a degree in Cybersecurity in 2024. <BR /><BR />

Before his IT and Security journey, Brad served in the US Army. <BR /><BR />
I am starting to shift my focus away from PowerShell scripting to Python development. I will still support my larger PowerShell projects but newer projects will be in Python.
